# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Start from here

The `export` JavaScript keyword makes this function accessible outside of this file.
The `default` keyword tells other files using your code that itâ€™s the main function in your file.

### React ES6 Classes

# Classes

ES6 introduced classes.

A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword `function` to initiate it, we use the keyword `class`, and the properties are assigned inside a `constructor()` method.

```
class Car {
    constructor(name) {
        this.brand = name;
    }
}
```

# Method in Classes

Create a method named "present":

```
class Car {
    constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
    }

    present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
    }
}

const mycar = new Car("Ford");
mycar.present();
```

# Class Inheritance

To create a class inheritance, use the `extends` keyword.

A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:
Create a class named "Model" which will inherit the methods from the "Car" class:

```
class Car {
    constructor(name) {
        this.brand = name;
    }

    present() {
        return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
    }
}

class Model extends Car {
    constructor(name, mod) {
    super(name);
    this.model = mod;
    }
 show() {
    return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model
    }
}
const mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
mycar.show();
```

The `super()` method refers to the parent class.
By calling the `super()` method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and get access to the parent's properties and methods.

### React ES6 Arrow Functions

Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

```
hello = function() {
return "Hello World!";
}
```

With Arrow Function

```
hello = () => {
return "Hello World!";
}
```

Arrow Functions Return Value by Default:

```
hello = () => "Hello World!";
```

Arrow Function With Parameters:

```
hello = (val) => "Hello" + val;
```

In fact, if you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well:

```
hello = val => "Hello" +val;
```

What About this?
The handling of `this` is also different in arrow functions compared to regular functions.
In short, with arrow functions there is no binding of `this`.
In regular functions the `this` keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.
With a regular function, `this` represents the object that called the function:

```
class Header {
    constructor() {
        this.color = "Red";
    }

//Regular function:
    changeColor = function() {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this;
    }
}


const myheader = new Header();

//The window object calls the function:
window.addEventListener("load", myheader.changeColor);

//A button object calls the function:
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", myheader.changeColor);
```

### React ES6 Variables

**Variables**

Before ES6 there was only one way of defining your variables: with the `var` keyword. If you did not define them, they would be assigned to the global object. Unless you were in strict mode, then you would get an error if your variables were undefined.

Now, with ES6, there are three ways of defining your variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`.

> var x = 5.6;

_If you use `var` outside of a function, it belongs to the global scope._

_If you use `var` inside of a function, it belongs to that function._

_If you use `var` inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is still available outside of that block._

_`var` has a function scope, not a block scope._

> let x = 5.6;

_`let` is the block scoped version of var, and is limited to the block (or expression) where it is defined._

_If you use `let` inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is only available inside of that loop._

_`let` has a block scope._

> const x = 5.6;

_`const` is a variable that once it has been created, its value can never change._
_`const` has a block scope._

Because of this you can NOT:

- Reassign a constant value
- Reassign a constant array
- Reassign a constant object

But you CAN:

- Change the elements of constant array
- Change the properties of constant object

### React ES6 Array Methods

One of the most useful in React is the `.map()` array method.

The `.map()` method allows you to run a function on each item in the array, returning a new array as the result.

In React, `map()` can be used to generate lists.

```
const myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

const myList = myArray.map((item) => <p>{item}</p>)
```

### React ES6 Destructuring

**Destructuring**

To illustrate destructuring, we'll make a sandwich. Do you take everything out of the refrigerator to make your sandwich? No, you only take out the items you would like to use on your sandwich.

Destructuring is exactly the same. We may have an array or object that we are working with, but we only need some of the items contained in these.

Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed.

Destructing Arrays
Here is the old way of assigning array items to a variable:

Before

```
const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];
// old way
const car = vehicles[0];
const truck = vehicles[1];
const suv = vehicles[2];
```

With destructuring:

```
const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

const [car, truck, suv] = vehicles;


If we only want the car and suv we can simply leave out the truck but keep the comma:

const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

const [car,, suv] = vehicles;
```

Destructuring comes in handy when a function returns an array:

```
function calculate(a, b) {
  const add = a + b;
  const subtract = a - b;
  const multiply = a * b;
  const divide = a / b;

  return [add, subtract, multiply, divide];
}

const [add, subtract, multiply, divide] = calculate(4, 7);
```

**Destructuring Objects**

Before:

```
const vehicleOne = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021,
  color: 'red'
}

myVehicle(vehicleOne);

// old way
function myVehicle(vehicle) {
  const message = 'My ' + vehicle.type + ' is a ' + vehicle.color + ' ' + vehicle.brand + ' ' + vehicle.model + '.';
}
```

With destructuring:

```
const vehicleOne = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021,
  color: 'red'
}

myVehicle(vehicleOne);

function myVehicle({type, color, brand, model}) {
  const message = 'My ' + type + ' is a ' + color + ' ' + brand + ' ' + model + '.';
}
```
